# CardGame

Unfinished Web Card Game to play online. The project was at the start to create an original CCG like Hearthstone or MTG Arena but the project has been  let down. The remains are a deckbuilder and game instance that allow 1 player to challenge 1 other player in the friend list and then the start of the game create generating the decks preselected, dealing both hands, printing the cards and allow to even play some cards.
The graphics are bad but the backend code is easily reusable for other sites.
